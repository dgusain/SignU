# SignMimic
Robotics hand simulation for sign language using reinforced imitation learning

# current progress: 
1. Mujoco hand simulation has been rendered and the hand can perform basic sign movements.
2. The PoseTriplet framework is currently being adapted for RIL training.
3. Pose imitation will be using Hands4whole to capture poses from training videos.
